A Fallout(+) inspired Topdown Post Apocalyptic Survival Shooter. Survive against the climate, the locals, awful mutated creatures, and... Ethan?
--------------------------------

This is obviously a work in progress but stay tuned, I have little pygame experience and this is more of a training exercise than anything. development will continue over the coming weeks!

Thanks to Ethan Strohm for helping out with development and educating me on Pygame and Python more!
